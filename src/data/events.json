Tyrion observes that the presiding judge, his father, and his main accuser, Cersei, have wanted him dead for longer than anyone and that another of the judges, Mace Tyrell, will go along with whatever Tywin says.\n\nAll the witnesses against Tyrion are either his enemies or have otherwise been bribed or cajoled by his sister or father into testifying. Most give circumstantial, exaggerated, and sometimes outright false evidence, and Tyrion is not permitted to cross-examine them. It is also pretty apparent that Tyrion has no chance of acquittal.\n\nUltimately, Tyrion snaps at the injustice, insulting the entire court in the process.
